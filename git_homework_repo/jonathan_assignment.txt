Create regular expressions that search for each of the following.

    Passwords that contain your lowercase first name
    Passwords that start with the letter a
    Passwords that only consist of numbers
    Passwords that have any 5 letters followed by two numbers
    Passwords that contain a repeated 3 letter pattern (e.g., dogdog or catcat)

Hint: If you are using grep be sure to single-quote your regular expression: grep '...' 10k-common-passwords.txt.

1. lower case first name:
grep annabel 10k-common-passwords.txt 
annabell

2. start with a:
grep '^a.' 10k-common-passwords.txt

3. only #s:
grep -E '^\d+$' 10k-common-passwords.txt #need start (^) and end ($)anchors

4. 5 letters, 2 #s:
grep -E -i '^[A-Z]{5}\d{2}$' 10k-common-passwords.txt

5. repeated patterns: 
grep -E -i '^([a-z][a-z][a-z])\1+$' 10k-common-passwords.txt 

#so the \1 field can be used within the expression, not just in replace
